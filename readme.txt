Let’s take a look at its settings, and see how simple they actually are.

All the settings of the app are divided into three categories, each on its own tab.

The first tab is called Source. As the name suggests, on this tab you select the social icons to display, and link them to your social profile. To be able to do it, you need first to press “Add” button to redirect to social icon configuration screen. The next step is to select the logo of the icon you need from the dropdown list, and paste the link to your social media account to the field below. That’s it, you’ve just set an icon and linked it to your profile!

The second tab is called Layout, and it’s probably the easiest to set up, and it has only one option. ON this tab you can set the size of the Social Icons widget. For your greater convenience, we offer you five predefined sizes in pixels – 24, 32, 40, 48, 60. Choose one that will be just perfect on your website!

The last but not the least is the Style tab. There are several settings you can configure there, let’s analyze them one by one. 

The first setting is Style. To set the style you need to choose one of the predefined ones from the dropdown list. We offer you 6 styling options, to make the icons blend into your website in the best possible way.

After the styles come colors. There are three predefined color schemes – native, black and white. They can be combined in any way. This means that you can set different colors for different widget elements.

You can also choose the icons’ border ratio to make them fit your website better. We offer you three options – circle, rounded and square, and we hope you’ll find the right one.

To make the social icons get even more attention from your visitors, you can set their animation. We offer you five predefined modes – bounce, fly, rotate, slide and zoom. Or, if you choose, you can have no animation at all. Next, set the icons’ transparency in %, and you’re done configuring your Social Icons widget!

We hope this article provides you with the information you need, but in case you should have any questions, our friendly Support Team is always there for you! Just message us at apps@elfsight.com and we’ll be happy to help in every way we can!
